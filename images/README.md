# Visual Materials for Temporal Optimizer Research

This directory contains visual materials that explain the core concepts behind Hamiltonian mechanics applied to SGD optimization.

## Key Visualizations

### Hamiltonian Neural Networks Concept
- **Weights as Hamiltonian Space**: Shows how neural network weights can be viewed through the lens of Hamiltonian mechanics with energy states and feature separation
- **Energy Conservation**: Visualization of how features naturally separate into lower energy systems
- **Superposition vs Disentanglement**: Illustrates the transition from high-energy polysemantic representations to low-energy disentangled features

### Usage Rights
These visualizations are part of our research presentation materials and can be used for:
- Academic presentations and papers
- Educational content about physics-informed optimization
- Research discussions and collaborations
- Social media promotion of the research
